1. Basic Flask Application Setup
Created Flask app: Set up the initial app.py file with basic routing and functionality.
Implemented face detection and landmark drawing: Integrated dlib for facial landmark detection and OpenCV for image processing.
2. Improved User Experience
Added CSS for styling: Styled index.html and result.html for a polished look.
Added error handling: Updated app.py to handle cases where no file is uploaded or if no faces are detected.
3. Enhanced Functionality
Multiple image uploads:
Modified app.py to handle and process multiple file uploads.
Updated the index.html form to support multiple files and added a gallery view for processed images.
Next Steps for Enhancement
Security and Performance Improvements:

File type validation: Ensure only image files are accepted.
Limit file size: Set a maximum file size limit to prevent large file uploads.
Use a production-ready server: Consider deploying with a production WSGI server like Gunicorn.
Additional Features:

Image filters: Implement additional image filters and effects.
User authentication: Add user accounts and authentication if needed.
More advanced image processing: Implement more complex image processing or machine learning models.
Testing and Deployment:

Unit and integration tests: Write tests to ensure functionality is working as expected.
Deployment: Prepare your app for deployment on a platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
Documentation and Maintenance:

Documentation: Document the setup and usage of your application.
Maintenance: Regularly update dependencies and review code for improvements.
